        <h4>
          Many people nowadays can't put a price on their head, even after working for several years.
          Some underestimate their market value, and some overestimate it. It can be very difficult to get accurate data
          in this vast ocean of information : for example, you want to know how much you can ask what salary increase
          you can get for a junior commercial job, after two years of experience in the same company.
          You start to look, but you realize information given is all over the place : salary in different currencies
          and countries, you don't find people with same skills as yours, or in the same sector as you work in, and in
          your place, no one wants to share their salary.
          <br>
          <br>
